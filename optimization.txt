LP linear programming
	simplex method
	karmarkarâ€™s method
QP unconstrained quadratic programming
	equivalent to solving system of linear equations
	requires Q matrix to be SPD for convergence
	efficiently solved using conjugate gradient and successive over-relaxation
	hcdc can solve using block cyclic coordinate descent
	symbolically find the partial derivative with respect to four chosen variables
	requires four integrators, 16 multipliers in the worst case
LCQP linearly constrained quadratic programming
	integrator saturation will be set to the active set constraint
QCQP quadratically constrained quadratic programming
	maps from linear quadratic control
	quadratic constraints would be harder to imitate in hcdc
	if using the barrier function approach with a logarithmic barrier, can use hybrid loop
	linear system dynamics with a goal state constraint results in qcqp
	has applications in predictive model control or receding horizon control
	ideally, the analog circuitry should be used to model forward dynamics
	but in optimal control, the set of all future control decisions are variables to optimize
	and forward dynamics is modeled as constrains relating discrete steps
SOCP second order cone programming
